# Journey maps

Guest: preview examples then create account; adult: setup first plan then invited family, vote round, approve trip, confirm grocery purchase, review feedback; minor: parent-managed entry, choose approved meal, play age-appropriate game, stop and return; lost connection: cached content + conflict queue, no purchase offline.

## Implementation contract

1. Design inputs and version them before implementing.
2. Validate the actor's role and circle membership on the server before reading or writing private data.
3. Treat uncertainty as a product state, not as permission to fabricate data.
4. Emit privacy-minimized typed events only when processing is authorized.
5. Apply explicit test fixtures for success, empty, invalid, outage and cross-tenant use.
6. Document dependencies, rollback flags and operational observability.
7. Preserve accessibility, offline behavior and child safety across all features.
