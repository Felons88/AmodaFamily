# Progressive onboarding

Required: adult authorization, household size and age bands (not full DOB), mandatory food exclusions/allergies, budget period and value to rank affordable meals; all others skippable. After first plan ask optional beverage habits, replenishment cadence, prep-time preference, pantry staples. One question per relevant moment, never collect unnecessary location or payment data.

## Implementation contract

1. Design inputs and version them before implementing.
2. Validate the actor's role and circle membership on the server before reading or writing private data.
3. Treat uncertainty as a product state, not as permission to fabricate data.
4. Emit privacy-minimized typed events only when processing is authorized.
5. Apply explicit test fixtures for success, empty, invalid, outage and cross-tenant use.
6. Document dependencies, rollback flags and operational observability.
7. Preserve accessibility, offline behavior and child safety across all features.
